# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to understand the reasons behind the high turnover among entry- and lower-level employees and identify changes that could improve employee satisfaction and retention. The survey will also provide measurable indicators that can be tracked over time through repeated annual surveys.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population:
All employees of the company, with a focus on entry- and lower-level positions where turnover is highest.

Sampling frame:
The company’s internal employee email directory, which includes all active employees.

Sampling unit:
Each individual employee selected to receive the survey.

Observational unit:
Each completed survey response from an employee.

Sampling strategy:
A stratified random sampling approach will be used. Employees will first be grouped into strata based on organization (department), and then by geographic location if needed. A random sample will be selected from each stratum to ensure representation across the organization.
The survey will be distributed through a secure third-party platform to ensure anonymity and encourage honest responses.

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:






```
Objective:
0. The two primary objectives of the General Social Survey (GSS) are:
        - To gather data on social trends to monitor changes in the living conditions and well-being of Canadians over time.
        - To provide information on specific social policy issues of current or emerging interest.


Features:

1. Sample type: 
        The survey is a probability sample survey with a cross-sectional design, using a structured questionnaire administered to selected respondents.

2. Sample size: 
        Initial field sample: approximately 50,000 units.

        About 40,000 invitation letters were sent to selected households for the electronic questionnaire.

        Expected number of completed questionnaires: approximately 24,000.

3. Target population: 
        The target population includes all persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada. It excludes full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.

4. Sampling frame

        The survey used a combined telephone and dwelling frame, including:
        - Landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and administrative sources
        - Statistics Canada dwelling frame

        Records consisted of one or more telephone numbers linked to an address when possible.

        Sampling characteristics:
                - Stratified probability sampling design
                - Stratification at the province/CMA (Census Metropolitan Area) level
                - One randomly selected household member aged 15+
                - No proxy responses permitted

        Special design feature:
                - Rejective sampling was used to manage volunteer prevalence.
                - All identified volunteers completed a long interview.
                - Non-volunteers were randomly assigned to either a long or short interview.


5. Survey mode(s) 
        Data were collected using:
                - Electronic self-administered questionnaire (online)
                - Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI)

        The questionnaire was developed through consultations and qualitative testing conducted by Statistics Canada’s Questionnaire Design Resource Centre


6. Timeline
        Data collection priod: 2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28

7. Response rate: 
        The overall response rate is 41.9%.

8. Weights

        Survey weights were applied to ensure estimates represent the target population.

        Key features:
                - Each respondent represents multiple individuals in the population.

                - Adjustments made for:
                        - Sampling design
                        - Rejective sampling of non-volunteers
                        - Non-response

                - Weights calibrated to match external income distributions by province.

        Main weight:
                WGHT_PER: Person-level analysis weight

        Variance estimation:
                Bootstrap weights provided for design-based variance estimation.


9. Data processing

        Data collection:
                - Conducted via electronic questionnaire or CATI.
                - Average completion time: approximately 44 minutes.
                - Interviews available in English and French.
                - No proxy responses allowed.

        Administrative linkage:
                - Survey responses were linked to personal tax records (T1, T1FF, T4) when consent was provided.
                - Linkage used to improve accuracy of income data.


10. Cleaning, imputation, etc

        Error detection
                - Processing used Statistics Canada’s Social Survey Processing Environment (SSPE).
                - Automated and manual edits applied at micro and macro levels.
                - Types of edits included:
                        - Range checks
                        - Consistency checks
                        - Flow edits
                        - Family relationship checks
        
        CATI system included built-in validation during interviews.

        Imputation
                - Primarily donor imputation using a score-based nearest-neighbour method.
                - If no suitable donor was available, mean imputation was used.
        Imputation steps included:
                - Personal and family income
                - Formal volunteering variables
                - Informal volunteering variables
                - Donation and solicitation variables

        Income handling:
                - Personal income obtained from 2017 tax data for 81.9% of respondents.
                - Family income obtained for 81.7% of households.
                - Missing values were imputed.




11. Sources of error
        The methodology of this survey has been designed to limit the number of errors and to reduce their potential effects. However, the results of the survey remain subject to both sampling and non-sampling error.

        Sampling error
                - Estimates are subject to variability due to sampling.
                - Sampling variability estimated using bootstrap methods.

        Non-sampling error
                - Main sources include
                - Coverage error
                - Non-response
                - Response error
                - Processing error

        Coverage limitations:
                - Households without telephones were excluded from the sampling frame.
                - Weighting adjustments used to reduce bias.




12. Limitations, known biases, etc

        Non-response bias is a key limitation.

        Mitigation methods:
                - Weight adjustments for non-response.
                - Use of administrative data (e.g., income, household composition) to model and adjust for non-responding households.
